The idea is to extend the taxonomy of computational patterns defined in the article “The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research” published in 2006 to data analytics in heterogeneous environments. Implementing basic structures and algorithms once for multiple devices strives to find a balance between performance and specific capabilities usage, and implementation effort. We chose platform-agnostic tools to express our language of patterns (OpenCL, SYCL).</description></item><item><title>Altis Sycl</title><link>http://oneapi-community.github.io/projects/altis-sycl/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 12:51:11 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://oneapi-community.github.io/projects/altis-sycl/</guid><description>Altis-SYCL is a SYCL-based implementation of the Altis GPGPU benchmark suite (originally written in CUDA) for CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.
Altis-SYCL has been migrated from CUDA using the DPC++ Compatibility Tool (DPCT) of oneAPI v2022.1. Our main focus is to evaluate the performance of these GPU-tailored SYCL kernels and to investigate their optimization potential for FPGAs. For some cases, minor code changes were made to speedup the FPGA port as our interest lies in the achievable performance without major rework of the kernels.</description></item></channel></rss>
